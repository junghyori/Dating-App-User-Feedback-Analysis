# Dating-App-User-Feedback-Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing user reviews of the Bumble dating app, as collected from the Google Play Store. The analysis includes topic modelling to identify common themes or issues users have with the app, as well as sentiment analysis to assess user sentiment towards the app.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis was collected from the Google Play Store and contains over 1000 user reviews of the Bumble dating app. The dataset can be accessed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivkumarganesh/bumble-dating-app-google-play-store-review)

## Results
The topic modelling analysis identified 10 topics in the user review data. Each topic represents a common theme or issue that users have with the app, such as technical issues, dating experience, user interface, security, and account management. This can help the product team prioritize and address specific user concerns or pain points in order to improve the user experience and drive engagement on the platform.

The sentiment score analysis indicated that users have a generally neutral to slightly positive view of the app, with some topics having slightly more positive or negative sentiment. Users express some positive feelings about the dating experience facilitated by the app, but also have concerns about fake profiles, privacy, and account management.

These results suggest that the app's user experience may be a critical area for improvement, with specific focus on messaging functionality, swiping and user interface, and addressing user concerns related to privacy and account management. Additionally, the analysis highlights the importance of addressing concerns related to fraudulent activity and security, as well as optimizing the app's technical performance to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Usage
The code in this repository can be used to analyze user reviews for the Bumble dating app or any other similar platform. Simply replace the input data with your own user review data and run the analysis scripts. The extracted features can be used to inform product development and design decisions, while the sentiment analysis can provide insights into user sentiment towards the app.
